    "Description": "𝗕𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗳 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\r\nGives some extra health to the second player playing on splitscreen. \r\n\r\n𝗪𝗵𝘆?\r\nTrying to learn some basic scripting stuff on BO3! So I wanted to help a redditor that asked for this specific feature while playing with his girlfriend.\r\n\r\n𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰\r\nPlayers base health when spawning is 100, Juggernog just adds a +100 on the base health.\r\nThe splitscreen second player will now have 400 as base health, so 500 with Juggernog!\r\n\r\nThis mod does nothing if there's no splitscreen second player.\r\n",
